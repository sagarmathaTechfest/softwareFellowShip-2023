Variable Naming Rules

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Illegal Names:

2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"

Variable Nameing Techniques:

- Camel Case: thisIsACamelCase
- Snake Case: this_is_a_snake_case
- Pascal Case: ThisIsAPascalCase

Note: Variables are case sensitive
